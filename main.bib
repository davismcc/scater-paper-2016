                 high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is complicated by
                 several sources of measurement variability and poses numerous
                 statistical challenges. We present Cuffdiff 2, an algorithm
                 that estimates expression at transcript-level resolution and
                 controls for variability evident across replicate libraries.
                 Cuffdiff 2 robustly identifies differentially expressed
                 transcripts and genes and reveals differential splicing and
                 promoter-preference changes. We demonstrate the accuracy of
                 our approach through differential analysis of lung fibroblasts
                 in response to loss of the developmental transcription factor
                 HOXA1, which we show is required for lung fibroblast and HeLa

                 expression level changes in thousands of individual

                 regulators of the cell cycle. Cuffdiff 2 performs robust
                 differential analysis in RNA-seq experiments at transcript

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Digital gene expression (DGE) technologies measure
              gene expression by counting sequence tags. They are sensitive
              technologies for measuring gene expression on a genomic scale,
              without the need for prior knowledge of the genome sequence. As
              the cost of sequencing DNA decreases, the number of DGE datasets
              is expected to grow dramatically. Various tests of differential
              expression have been proposed for replicated DGE data using
              binomial, Poisson, negative binomial or pseudo-likelihood (PL)
              models for the counts, but none of the these are usable when the
              number of replicates is very small. RESULTS: We develop tests
              using the negative binomial distribution to model overdispersion
              relative to the Poisson, and use conditional weighted likelihood
              to moderate the level of overdispersion across genes. Not only is
              our strategy applicable even with the smallest number of
              libraries, but it also proves to be more powerful than previous
              strategies when more libraries are available. The methodology is
              equally applicable to other counting technologies, such as
              proteomic spectral counts. AVAILABILITY: An R package can be

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Understanding the regulation of gene expression,
                 including transcription start site usage, alternative
                 splicing, and polyadenylation, requires accurate
                 quantification of expression levels down to the level of
                 individual transcript isoforms. To comparatively evaluate the
                 accuracy of the many methods that have been proposed for
                 estimating transcript isoform abundance from RNA sequencing
                 data, we have used both synthetic data as well as an
                 independent experimental method for quantifying the abundance
                 of transcript ends at the genome-wide level. RESULTS: We found
                 that many tools have good accuracy and yield better estimates
                 of gene-level expression compared to commonly used count-based
                 approaches, but they vary widely in memory and runtime
                 requirements. Nucleotide composition and intron/exon structure
                 have comparatively little influence on the accuracy of
                 expression estimates, which correlates most strongly with
                 transcript/gene expression levels. To facilitate the
                 reproduction and further extension of our study, we provide
                 datasets, source code, and an online analysis tool on a
                 companion website, where developers can upload expression
                 estimates obtained with their own tool to compare them to
                 those inferred by the methods assessed here. CONCLUSIONS: As
                 many methods for quantifying isoform abundance with comparable
                 accuracy are available, a user's choice will likely be
                 determined by factors such as the memory and runtime
                 requirements, as well as the availability of methods for
                 downstream analyses. Sequencing-based methods to quantify the
                 abundance of specific transcript regions could complement
                 validation schemes based on synthetic data and quantitative
                 PCR in future or ongoing assessments of RNA-seq analysis

              digital measure of the presence and prevalence of transcripts

                 gene expression dynamics in a heterogeneous cell population.
                 Currently, a limited number of computational tools are
                 available for this task, and quantitative methods for
                 comparing different tools are lacking. Tools for Single Cell
                 Analysis (TSCAN) is a software tool developed to better
                 support in silico pseudo-Time reconstruction in Single-Cell
                 RNA-seq ANalysis. TSCAN uses a cluster-based minimum spanning
                 tree (MST) approach to order cells. Cells are first grouped
                 into clusters and an MST is then constructed to connect
                 cluster centers. Pseudo-time is obtained by projecting each
                 cell onto the tree, and the ordered sequence of cells can be
                 used to study dynamic changes of gene expression along the
                 pseudo-time. Clustering cells before MST construction reduces
                 the complexity of the tree space. This often leads to improved
                 cell ordering. It also allows users to conveniently adjust the
                 ordering based on prior knowledge. TSCAN has a graphical user
                 interface (GUI) to support data visualization and user
                 interaction. Furthermore, quantitative measures are developed
                 to objectively evaluate and compare different pseudo-time
                 reconstruction methods. TSCAN is available at

              that these zeros, or dropouts, are due to failure of the reverse
              transcription, and we model the process using the

  abstract    = "MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing technology allows
                 detection of gene expression at the single-cell level. One
                 typical feature of the data is a bimodality in the cellular
                 distribution even for highly expressed genes, primarily caused
                 by a proportion of non-expressing cells. The standard and the
                 over-dispersed gamma-Poisson models that are commonly used in
                 bulk-cell RNA-sequencing are not able to capture this
                 property. RESULTS: We introduce a beta-Poisson mixture model
                 that can capture the bimodality of the single-cell gene
                 expression distribution. We further integrate the model into
                 the generalized linear model framework in order to perform
                 differential expression analyses. The whole analytical
                 procedure is called BPSC. The results from several real
                 single-cell RNA-seq datasets indicate that ∼90\% of the
                 transcripts are well characterized by the beta-Poisson model;
                 the model-fit from BPSC is better than the fit of the standard
                 gamma-Poisson model in > 80\% of the transcripts. Moreover, in
                 differential expression analyses of simulated and real
                 datasets, BPSC performs well against edgeR, a conventional
                 method widely used in bulk-cell RNA-sequencing data, and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: High-throughput sequencing technologies, such as the
              Illumina Genome Analyzer, are powerful new tools for
              investigating a wide range of biological and medical questions.
              Statistical and computational methods are key for drawing
              meaningful and accurate conclusions from the massive and complex
              datasets generated by the sequencers. We provide a detailed
              evaluation of statistical methods for normalization and
              differential expression (DE) analysis of Illumina transcriptome
              sequencing (mRNA-Seq) data. RESULTS: We compare statistical
              methods for detecting genes that are significantly DE between two
              types of biological samples and find that there are substantial
              differences in how the test statistics handle low-count genes. We
              evaluate how DE results are affected by features of the
              sequencing platform, such as, varying gene lengths, base-calling
              calibration method (with and without phi X control lane), and
              flow-cell/library preparation effects. We investigate the impact
              of the read count normalization method on DE results and show
              that the standard approach of scaling by total lane counts (e.g.,
              RPKM) can bias estimates of DE. We propose more general
              quantile-based normalization procedures and demonstrate an
              improvement in DE detection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results have
              significant practical and methodological implications for the
              design and analysis of mRNA-Seq experiments. They highlight the
              importance of appropriate statistical methods for normalization
              and DE inference, to account for features of the sequencing
              platform that could impact the accuracy of results. They also

                 associated with different clinical states is important for the
                 study of human biology. However, clinical samples used in gene
                 expression studies are often derived from heterogeneous
                 mixtures with variable cell-type composition, complicating
                 statistical analysis. Considerable effort has been devoted to
                 modeling sample heterogeneity, and presently, there are many
                 methods that can estimate cell proportions or pure cell-type
                 expression from mixture data. However, there is no method that
                 comprehensively addresses mixture analysis in the context of
                 differential expression without relying on additional
                 proportion information, which can be inaccurate and is
                 frequently unavailable. RESULTS: In this study, we consider a
                 clinically relevant situation where neither accurate
                 proportion estimates nor pure cell expression is of direct
                 interest, but where we are rather interested in detecting and
                 interpreting relevant differential expression in mixture
                 samples. We develop a method, Cell-type COmputational
                 Differential Estimation (CellCODE), that addresses the
                 specific statistical question directly, without requiring a
                 physical model for mixture components. Our approach is based
                 on latent variable analysis and is computationally
                 transparent; it requires no additional experimental data, yet
                 outperforms existing methods that use independent proportion
                 measurements. CellCODE has few parameters that are robust and
                 easy to interpret. The method can be used to track changes in
                 proportion, improve power to detect differential expression
                 and assign the differentially expressed genes to the correct
                 cell type.",

                 such as batch effects can dramatically reduce the accuracy of
                 statistical inference in genomic experiments. These sources of
                 noise must be modeled and removed to accurately measure
                 biological variability and to obtain correct statistical
                 inference when performing high-throughput genomic analysis. We
                 introduced surrogate variable analysis (sva) for estimating
                 these artifacts by (i) identifying the part of the genomic
                 data only affected by artifacts and (ii) estimating the
                 artifacts with principal components or singular vectors of the

                 artifacts can be used in subsequent analyses as adjustment

                 such as cell differentiation is challenging owing to the high
                 variability in gene expression between individual cells.
                 Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have
                 difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a
                 transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of
                 cells, and single-cell proteomic methods rely on a priori
                 knowledge of key distinguishing markers. Here we describe

                 resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq

  abstract = "SUMMARY: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression
              (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the
              near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the
              fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression
              studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that
              counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different
              across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software
              package for examining differential expression of replicated count
              data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both
              biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are
              used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts,
              improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be
              used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided
              at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated.
              The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data,
              such as proteome peptide count data. AVAILABILITY: The package is

                 dozens of parameters simultaneously in individual cells, data
                 interpretation can be challenging. Here we present viSNE, a
                 tool that allows one to map high-dimensional cytometry data
                 onto two dimensions, yet conserve the high-dimensional
                 structure of the data. viSNE plots individual cells in a
                 visual similar to a scatter plot, while using all pairwise
                 distances in high dimension to determine each cell's location
                 in the plot. We integrated mass cytometry with viSNE to map
                 healthy and cancerous bone marrow samples. Healthy bone marrow
                 automatically maps into a consistent shape, whereas leukemia
                 samples map into malformed shapes that are distinct from
                 healthy bone marrow and from each other. We also use viSNE and
                 mass cytometry to compare leukemia diagnosis and relapse
                 samples, and to identify a rare leukemia population

                 experimental readouts of gene expression, such as microarrays
                 and RNA-sequencing, log transformation is routinely applied.
                 This is because expression data, like many biological
                 parameters, are strongly skewed. We show here that gene
                 expression levels in multicellular organisms often deviate
                 from simple (log) normal distributions and instead exhibit
                 shouldered or bimodal distributions. Based on a mathematical
                 model and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that many
                 observed distributions can be explained as mixtures of bimodal
                 two-component lognormal models. This is due to the fact that
                 after log-transformation, the resulting distributions display
                 reductions in the first peak rather than increasing overlaps
                 over a wide range of parameter values. By comparing the
                 theoretical results with biological datasets, our findings
                 suggest that the distributions are generally bimodal for
                 single cell types and get obscured by the different cell types
                 that are present in tissue samples. Our analysis thus provides
                 an initial explanation for the various types of expression
                 level distributions that are found for different datasets.
                 This will be important for the interpretation of
                 next-generation sequencing data such as transcriptomics by

  abstract    = ": Diffusion maps are a spectral method for non-linear
                 dimension reduction and have recently been adapted for the
                 visualization of single-cell expression data. Here we present
                 destiny, an efficient R implementation of the diffusion map
                 algorithm. Our package includes a single-cell specific noise
                 model allowing for missing and censored values. In contrast to
                 previous implementations, we further present an efficient
                 nearest-neighbour approximation that allows for the processing
                 of hundreds of thousands of cells and a functionality for
                 projecting new data on existing diffusion maps. We exemplarily
                 apply destiny to a recent time-resolved mass cytometry dataset
                 of cellular reprogramming. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:

  abstract = "Single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has become the most widely
              used high-throughput method for transcription profiling of

              have been widely reported as a major challenge in high-throughput

              attention in published studies based on scRNA-Seq technology. We
              examined data from five published studies and found that
              systematic errors can explain a substantial percentage of
              observed cell-to-cell expression variability. Specifically, we
              found that the proportion of genes reported as expressed explains
              a substantial part of observed variability and that this quantity
              varies systematically across experimental batches. Furthermore,
              we found that the implemented experimental designs confounded
              outcomes of interest with batch effects, a design that can bring
              into question some of the conclusions of these studies. Finally,
              we propose a simple experimental design that can ameliorate the
              effect of theses systematic errors have on downstream results.",

  author   = "Leek, Jeffrey T and Storey, John D",
  abstract = "It has unambiguously been shown that genetic, environmental,
              demographic, and technical factors may have substantial effects
              on gene expression levels. In addition to the measured
              variable(s) of interest, there will tend to be sources of signal
              due to factors that are unknown, unmeasured, or too complicated
              to capture through simple models. We show that failing to
              incorporate these sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can
              have widespread and detrimental effects on the study. Not only
              can this reduce power or induce unwanted dependence across genes,
              but it can also introduce sources of spurious signal to many
              genes. This phenomenon is true even for well-designed, randomized
              studies. We introduce ``surrogate variable analysis'' (SVA) to
              overcome the problems caused by heterogeneity in expression
              studies. SVA can be applied in conjunction with standard analysis
              techniques to accurately capture the relationship between
              expression and any modeled variables of interest. We apply SVA to
              disease class, time course, and genetics of gene expression
              studies. We show that SVA increases the biological accuracy and
              reproducibility of analyses in genome-wide expression studies.",

                 expression of only a few known marker genes. The unequivocal
                 identification of a specific marker gene, however, poses a
                 major challenge, particularly if this cell type is rare.
                 Identifying rare cell types, such as stem cells, short-lived
                 progenitors, cancer stem cells, or circulating tumour cells,
                 is crucial to acquire a better understanding of normal or
                 diseased tissue biology. To address this challenge we first
                 sequenced the transcriptome of hundreds of randomly selected
                 cells from mouse intestinal organoids, cultured
                 self-organizing epithelial structures that contain all cell
                 lineages of the mammalian intestine. Organoid buds, like
                 intestinal crypts, harbour stem cells that continuously
                 differentiate into a variety of cell types, occurring at
                 widely different abundances. Since available computational
                 methods can only resolve more abundant cell types, we
                 developed RaceID, an algorithm for rare cell type
                 identification in complex populations of single cells. We
                 demonstrate that this algorithm can resolve cell types
                 represented by only a single cell in a population of randomly
                 sampled organoid cells. We use this algorithm to identify Reg4
                 as a novel marker for enteroendocrine cells, a rare population
                 of hormone-producing intestinal cells. Next, we use Reg4
                 expression to enrich for these rare cells and investigate the
                 heterogeneity within this population. RaceID confirmed the
                 existence of known enteroendocrine lineages, and moreover
                 discovered novel subtypes, which we subsequently validated in
                 vivo. Having validated RaceID we then applied the algorithm to
                 ex vivo-isolated Lgr5-positive stem cells and their direct
                 progeny. We find that Lgr5-positive cells represent a
                 homogenous abundant population of stem cells mixed with a rare
                 population of Lgr5-positive secretory cells. We envision broad
                 applicability of our method for discovering rare cell types
                 and the corresponding marker genes in healthy and diseased
                 organs.",

  abstract    = "In mammals, specification of the three major germ layers
                 occurs during gastrulation, when cells ingressing through the
                 primitive streak differentiate into the precursor cells of
                 major organ systems. However, the molecular mechanisms
                 underlying this process remain unclear, as numbers of
                 gastrulating cells are very limited. In the mouse embryo at
                 embryonic day 6.5, cells located at the junction between the
                 extra-embryonic region and the epiblast on the posterior side
                 of the embryo undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
                 and ingress through the primitive streak. Subsequently, cells
                 migrate, either surrounding the prospective ectoderm
                 contributing to the embryo proper, or into the extra-embryonic
                 region to form the yolk sac, umbilical cord and placenta. Fate
                 mapping has shown that mature tissues such as blood and heart
                 originate from specific regions of the pre-gastrula epiblast,
                 but the plasticity of cells within the embryo and the function
                 of key cell-type-specific transcription factors remain
                 unclear. Here we analyse 1,205 cells from the epiblast and
                 nascent Flk1(+) mesoderm of gastrulating mouse embryos using
                 single-cell RNA sequencing, representing the first
                 transcriptome-wide in vivo view of early mesoderm formation
                 during mammalian gastrulation. Additionally, using knockout
                 mice, we study the function of Tal1, a key haematopoietic
                 transcription factor, and demonstrate, contrary to previous
                 studies performed using retrospective assays, that Tal1
                 knockout does not immediately bias precursor cells towards a
                 cardiac fate.",

                 levels or the transcriptome composition between given
                 conditions, and as a first step, the sequencing reads must be
                 used as the basis for abundance quantification of
                 transcriptomic features of interest, such as genes or
                 transcripts. Several different quantification approaches have
                 been proposed, ranging from simple counting of reads that
                 overlap given genomic regions to more complex estimation of
                 underlying transcript abundances. In this paper, we show that
                 gene-level abundance estimates and statistical inference offer
                 advantages over transcript-level analyses, in terms of
                 performance and interpretability. We also illustrate that

                 abundance estimates improve the performance in simulated data,
                 the difference is relatively minor in several real data sets.

                 mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or
                 each gene. The process of counting reads is called read
                 summarization. Read summarization is required for a great
                 variety of genomic analyses but has so far received relatively

                 from a seemingly homogenous population, individual cells can
                 exhibit substantial differences in gene expression, protein
                 levels and phenotypic output, with important functional
                 consequences. Existing studies of cellular heterogeneity,
                 however, have typically measured only a few pre-selected RNAs
                 or proteins simultaneously, because genomic profiling methods
                 could not be applied to single cells until very recently. Here
                 we use single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate heterogeneity
                 in the response of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells
                 (BMDCs) to lipopolysaccharide. We find extensive, and
                 previously unobserved, bimodal variation in messenger RNA
                 abundance and splicing patterns, which we validate by
                 RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization for select transcripts.
                 In particular, hundreds of key immune genes are bimodally
                 expressed across cells, surprisingly even for genes that are
                 very highly expressed at the population average. Moreover,
                 splicing patterns demonstrate previously unobserved levels of
                 heterogeneity between cells. Some of the observed bimodality
                 can be attributed to closely related, yet distinct, known
                 maturity states of BMDCs; other portions reflect differences
                 in the usage of key regulatory circuits. For example, we
                 identify a module of 137 highly variable, yet co-regulated,
                 antiviral response genes. Using cells from knockout mice, we
                 show that variability in this module may be propagated through
                 an interferon feedback circuit, involving the transcriptional
                 regulators Stat2 and Irf7. Our study demonstrates the power
                 and promise of single-cell genomics in uncovering functional
                 diversity between cells and in deciphering cell states and
                 circuits.",

  abstract    = "A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis
                 of read counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It
                 provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving
                 multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while
                 still taking full account of biological variation. Biological
                 variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the
                 technical variation associated with sequencing technologies.
                 Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own
                 specific variability, even when there are relatively few
                 biological replicates from which to estimate such variability.
                 The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the
                 Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data
                 demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods
                 (GLMs) to detect differential expression in a paired design,
                 and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The
                 case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific
                 variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across
                 genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and
                 variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with
                 inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on
                 changes that are consistent between biological replicates.
                 Parallel computational approaches are developed to make
                 non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the
                 application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and
                 practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted
                 profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of
                 biological variability in complex situations. When variation
                 is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an
                 advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming
                 common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods
                 developed here can also be applied to count data arising from
                 DNA-Seq applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks

                 challenge, especially pertinent when considering dividing
                 populations of cells, is to understand the cell-cycle stage of
                 each captured cell. Here we describe and compare five
                 established supervised machine learning methods and a
                 custom-built predictor for allocating cells to their
                 cell-cycle stage on the basis of their transcriptome. In
                 particular, we assess the impact of different normalisation
                 strategies and the usage of prior knowledge on the predictive
                 power of the classifiers. We tested the methods on previously
                 published datasets and found that a PCA-based approach and the
                 custom predictor performed best. Moreover, our analysis shows
                 that the performance depends strongly on normalisation and the
                 usage of prior knowledge. Only by leveraging prior knowledge
                 in form of cell-cycle annotated genes and by preprocessing the
                 data using a rank-based normalisation, is it possible to
                 robustly capture the transcriptional cell-cycle signature
                 across different cell types, organisms and experimental
                 protocols.",

                 experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome
                 the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma
                 has been a popular choice for gene discovery through
                 differential expression analyses of microarray and
                 high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly
                 strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such
                 data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been
                 significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the
                 package can now perform both differential expression and
                 differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
                 data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted
                 to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well.
                 These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and
                 microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the
                 package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise
                 expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression
                 profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of
                 higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced
                 possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression
                 differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of
                 the limma package, summarizing both new and historical

                 essential to ensure accurate inference of expression levels.
                 Here, we show that usual normalization approaches mostly
                 account for sequencing depth and fail to correct for library
                 preparation and other more complex unwanted technical effects.
                 We evaluate the performance of the External RNA Control
                 Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls and investigate the
                 possibility of using them directly for normalization. We show
                 that the spike-ins are not reliable enough to be used in
                 standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization
                 procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove
                 unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical
                 effects by performing factor analysis on suitable sets of
                 control genes (e.g., ERCC spike-ins) or samples (e.g.,

                 estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential
                 expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods.
                 In particular, RUV promises to be valuable for large

                 tissues has been greatly aided by large-scale gene expression
                 analysis. However, tissues are invariably complex, and
                 expression analysis of a tissue confounds the true expression
                 patterns of its constituent cell types. Here we describe a
                 novel strategy to access such complex samples. Single-cell
                 RNA-seq expression profiles were generated, and clustered to
                 form a two-dimensional cell map onto which expression data
                 were projected. The resulting cell map integrates three levels
                 of organization: the whole population of cells, the
                 functionally distinct subpopulations it contains, and the
                 single cells themselves-all without need for known markers to
                 classify cell types. The feasibility of the strategy was
                 demonstrated by analyzing the transcriptomes of 85 single
                 cells of two distinct types. We believe this strategy will
                 enable the unbiased discovery and analysis of naturally

  abstract = "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: High throughput sequencing has become an
              important technology for studying expression levels in many types
              of genomic data. One key way of analysing such data is to look
              for elements of the data which display particular patterns of
              differential expression in order to take these forward for
              further analysis and validation. METHODS: We propose a framework
              for defining patterns of differential expression in terms of
              equivalence relations. We then develop a novel algorithm, baySeq,
              which uses an empirical Bayes approach to detect previously
              specified patterns of differential expression within a set of
              sequencing samples. The method assumes a negative binomial
              distribution for the data and derives an empirically determined
              prior distribution from the entire dataset. We examine the
              performance of the method on real and simulated data.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our method performs at least as well, and often
              better, than existing methods for analyses of pairwise
              differential expression in both real and simulated data. When we
              compare methods for the analysis of data from more complex
              experimental designs, our method again shows substantial gains in
              performance. We believe that this approach thus represents an
              important step forward for the analysis of count data from
              sequencing experiments.",

                 single-cell level has opened up new opportunities to elucidate
                 the heterogeneity of gene expression. One of the most
                 widespread applications of RNA-seq is to identify genes which
                 are differentially expressed between two experimental
                 conditions. RESULTS: We present a discrete, distributional
                 method for differential gene expression (D(3)E), a novel
                 algorithm specifically designed for single-cell RNA-seq data.
                 We use synthetic data to evaluate D(3)E, demonstrating that it
                 can detect changes in expression, even when the mean level
                 remains unchanged. Since D(3)E is based on an analytically
                 tractable stochastic model, it provides additional biological
                 insights by quantifying biologically meaningful properties,
                 such as the average burst size and frequency. We use D(3)E to
                 investigate experimental data, and with the help of the
                 underlying model, we directly test hypotheses about the
                 driving mechanism behind changes in gene expression.
                 CONCLUSION: Evaluation using synthetic data shows that D(3)E
                 performs better than other methods for identifying
                 differentially expressed genes since it is designed to take
                 full advantage of the information available from single-cell
                 RNA-seq experiments. Moreover, the analytical model underlying

  abstract    = "MOTIVATION: Single-cell technologies have recently gained
                 popularity in cellular differentiation studies regarding their
                 ability to resolve potential heterogeneities in cell
                 populations. Analyzing such high-dimensional single-cell data
                 has its own statistical and computational challenges. Popular
                 multivariate approaches are based on data normalization,
                 followed by dimension reduction and clustering to identify
                 subgroups. However, in the case of cellular differentiation,
                 we would not expect clear clusters to be present but instead
                 expect the cells to follow continuous branching lineages.
                 RESULTS: Here, we propose the use of diffusion maps to deal
                 with the problem of defining differentiation trajectories. We
                 adapt this method to single-cell data by adequate choice of
                 kernel width and inclusion of uncertainties or missing
                 measurement values, which enables the establishment of a
                 pseudotemporal ordering of single cells in a high-dimensional
                 gene expression space. We expect this output to reflect cell
                 differentiation trajectories, where the data originates from
                 intrinsic diffusion-like dynamics. Starting from a pluripotent
                 stage, cells move smoothly within the transcriptional
                 landscape towards more differentiated states with some
                 stochasticity along their path. We demonstrate the robustness
                 of our method with respect to extrinsic noise (e.g.
                 measurement noise) and sampling density heterogeneities on
                 simulated toy data as well as two single-cell quantitative
                 polymerase chain reaction datasets (i.e. mouse haematopoietic
                 stem cells and mouse embryonic stem cells) and an RNA-Seq data
                 of human pre-implantation embryos. We show that diffusion maps
                 perform considerably better than Principal Component Analysis
                 and are advantageous over other techniques for non-linear
                 dimension reduction such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour
                 Embedding for preserving the global structures and
                 pseudotemporal ordering of cells. AVAILABILITY AND

                 homogeneous populations of cells. However, these experiments
                 are prone to high levels of unexplained technical noise,
                 creating new challenges for identifying genes that show
                 genuine heterogeneous expression within the population of
                 cells under study. BASiCS (Bayesian Analysis of Single-Cell
                 Sequencing data) is an integrated Bayesian hierarchical model
                 where: (i) cell-specific normalisation constants are estimated
                 as part of the model parameters, (ii) technical variability is
                 quantified based on spike-in genes that are artificially
                 introduced to each analysed cell's lysate and (iii) the total
                 variability of the expression counts is decomposed into
                 technical and biological components. BASiCS also provides an
                 intuitive detection criterion for highly (or lowly) variable
                 genes within the population of cells under study. This is
                 formalised by means of tail posterior probabilities associated

                 contributions, quantities that can be easily interpreted by
                 users. We demonstrate our method using gene expression
                 measurements from mouse Embryonic Stem Cells. Cross-validation
                 and meaningful enrichment of gene ontology categories within

                 represented as distinctive cell subsets. A continuum of
                 transitional cell states exists between these discrete stages.
                 We combine the depth of single-cell mass cytometry and an

                 single cells of a given lineage onto a unified trajectory that

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Adapter trimming is a prerequisite step for
                 analyzing next-generation sequencing (NGS) data when the reads
                 are longer than the target DNA/RNA fragments. Although
                 typically used in small RNA sequencing, adapter trimming is
                 also used widely in other applications, such as genome DNA
                 sequencing and transcriptome RNA/cDNA sequencing, where
                 fragments shorter than a read are sometimes obtained because
                 of the limitations of NGS protocols. For the newly emerged
                 Nextera long mate-pair (LMP) protocol, junction adapters are
                 located in the middle of all properly constructed fragments;
                 hence, adapter trimming is essential to gain the correct
                 paired reads. However, our investigations have shown that few
                 adapter trimming tools meet both efficiency and accuracy
                 requirements simultaneously. The performances of these tools
                 can be even worse for paired-end and/or mate-pair sequencing.
                 RESULTS: To improve the efficiency of adapter trimming, we
                 devised a novel algorithm, the bit-masked k-difference
                 matching algorithm, which has O(kn) expected time with O(m)
                 space, where k is the maximum number of differences allowed, n
                 is the read length, and m is the adapter length. This
                 algorithm makes it possible to fully enumerate all candidates
                 that meet a specified threshold, e.g. error ratio, within a
                 short period of time. To improve the accuracy of this
                 algorithm, we designed a simple and easy-to-explain
                 statistical scoring scheme to evaluate candidates in the
                 pattern matching step. We also devised scoring schemes to
                 fully exploit the paired-end/mate-pair information when it is
                 applicable. All these features have been implemented in an
                 industry-standard tool named Skewer
                 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/skewer). Experiments on
                 simulated data, real data of small RNA sequencing, paired-end
                 RNA sequencing, and Nextera LMP sequencing showed that Skewer
                 outperforms all other similar tools that have the same
                 utility. Further, Skewer is considerably faster than other
                 tools that have comparative accuracies; namely, one times
                 faster for single-end sequencing, more than 12 times faster
                 for paired-end sequencing, and 49\% faster for LMP sequencing.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Skewer achieved as yet unmatched accuracies for
                 adapter trimming with low time bound.",

                 data from sequencing technologies. This article proposes an
                 elegantly simple multi-seed strategy, called seed-and-vote,
                 for mapping reads to a reference genome. The new strategy
                 chooses the mapped genomic location for the read directly from
                 the seeds. It uses a relatively large number of short seeds
                 (called subreads) extracted from each read and allows all the
                 seeds to vote on the optimal location. When the read length is
                 <160 bp, overlapping subreads are used. More conventional
                 alignment algorithms are then used to fill in detailed
                 mismatch and indel information between the subreads that make
                 up the winning voting block. The strategy is fast because the
                 overall genomic location has already been chosen before the
                 detailed alignment is done. It is sensitive because no
                 individual subread is required to map exactly, nor are
                 individual subreads constrained to map close by other
                 subreads. It is accurate because the final location must be
                 supported by several different subreads. The strategy extends
                 easily to find exon junctions, by locating reads that contain
                 sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same gene.
                 It scales up efficiently for longer reads.",

              align reads of various lengths produced by the latest sequencing
              technologies, while allowing for variable-length indels with
              respect to the reference genome. In addition to de novo spliced
              alignment, TopHat2 can align reads across fusion breaks, which
              can occur after genomic translocations. TopHat2 combines the
              ability to identify novel splice sites with direct mapping to
              known transcripts, producing sensitive and accurate alignments,
              even for highly repetitive genomes or in the presence of
              pseudogenes. TopHat2 is available at
